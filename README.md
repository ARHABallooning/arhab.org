# ARHAB

This is the static landing page for https://arhab.org hosted on GitHub Pages.

Flight postings are still served by the PHP site at https://flights.arhab.org

The previous code on ARHAB is a mess of hundreds of PHP, Perl, CGI, etc files, so the easiest method to keep the site running was to extract the "important" part and put it on a separate subdomain. Then to maintain some content and links, this static page provides an easy to update page that, while basic, still looks better than the old site.

Records are going to be moved to a Google Doc soon.

**Please send suggestions for more links / information to me via email**. Pull requests and new issues are also welcome here on Github.
